# ðŸ¦Š FOX Game â€” Avoid the Word

This is a minimalist game built with Python and Pygame where your objective is simple: **fill the board without accidentally forming the word "FOX"** in a row, column, or diagonal.

## ðŸŽ® Game Concept

- You are given a pool of **5 F's**, **6 O's**, and **5 X's** (total of 16 letters to fill the 4x4 board).
- Clicking on a square places a random letter from this pool.
- Once a square is filled, it can't be clicked again.
- The pool is randomly shuffled each game.
- There's **no undo**â€”so be careful!
- Your challenge is to **avoid** creating the word **FOX** in any line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).

This game is perfect as a simple puzzle, logic challenge, or even as a learning project for those new to game development with Pygame.
