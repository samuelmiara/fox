# ðŸ¦Š FOX Game

FOX Game is a simple grid-based game created using Python and Pygame. The core mechanic revolves around clicking squares to reveal random lettersâ€”specifically `'F'`, `'O'`, and `'X'`. The goal is to randomly fill the board with these letters and potentially form the word **FOX** across the board in a fun and engaging way.

## ðŸŽ® Game Concept

- The game board is a 4x4 grid of clickable squares.
- On each click, a random letter from a predefined pool (`'F'`, `'O'`, `'X'`) is displayed in the clicked square.
- The pool is shuffled before the game starts and each letter appears a fixed number of times.
- Once a square is clicked, it gets a letter and is no longer clickable.
- There's no win/lose condition implemented yet; it's a visual game mechanic focused on interaction and random placement.

This can serve as a foundation for a word or puzzle game, or as a learning tool for building Pygame-based applications.
